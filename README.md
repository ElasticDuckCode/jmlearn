# jmlearn

This is a personal learning library to exercise my understanding of different concepts 
in ML. This is not directed towards any use in real applications, but rather is my 
own little playground.

## Installation
To install this, I've simply created a virtual enviroment
```
python -m venv venv
```
and then installed this as the packages `jmlearn` into this venv
```
pip install -e .
```

Then it can be imported just like any other python library
```
import jmlearn
```
